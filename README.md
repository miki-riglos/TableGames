# Introduction
This my pet project to develop a table games platform and to get familiarized with real time applications.
Games state is stored in memory on the server and is pushed down to the clients whenever there is a change, some games have private state for each player.
Objects holding state are very similar on the server and client. The UI is updated using data binding.
